                Hi! My name is Alex and I want to become a professional developer. I spent five years at the University of Wisconsin double majoring in Biology and Jazz Studies, and graduated in 2017 with a Bachelor of Science. After I realized sometime around my last semester that neither of my majors were what I wanted to pursue as my career, I decided to try teaching myself to code and see what I thought. After spending a year teaching myself <a href="https://developer.apple.com/swift/" target="_blank">Swift</a> and loving every minute, I've decided I want to make coding my career!
            </p>
            
            <p>
                To that end, this fall I'm participating in the University of Minnesota's full time Coding Bootcamp. ***List technologies you'll learn*** After that's finished, I hope to become a web developer or software engineer in the Twin Cities area. ***List soft skills*** If I sound like the kind of developer you'd want in your company, feel free to <a href="contact.html" target="_blank">contact</a> me with questions, or just hire me!
            </p>

            <p>
                Seriously, please hire me.
            </p>
