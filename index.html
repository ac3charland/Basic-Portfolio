            Hi! My name is Alex and I want to become a professional developer. I 
            spent five years at the University of Wisconsin double majoring in
            Biology and Jazz Studies, and graduated in 2017 with a Bachelor of 
            Science. After I realized sometime around my last semester that neither 
            of my majors were what I wanted to pursue as my career, 
            I decided to try teaching myself to code and see what I thought. After
            spending a year teaching myself 
            <a href="https://developer.apple.com/swift/">Swift</a>
            and loving every minute, I've decided I want to make coding my career!
        </p>
        
        <p>
            To that end, this fall I'm participating in the University of Minnesota's 
            full time Coding Bootcamp. After that's finished, I hope to become a web 
            developer or software engineer in the Twin Cities area. If I sound like
            the kind of developer you'd want in your company, feel free to 
            <a href="contact.html">contact</a> me with questions, or just hire me!
        </p>

        <p>
            Seriously, please hire me.
